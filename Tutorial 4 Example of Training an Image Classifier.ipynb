    "# Tutorial 4. Example of Training an Image Classifier\n",
    "<br> This tutorial demostrates an example of training an image classifier with Pytorch and then transfer the training model to GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data description\n",
    "<br>Generally, when you have to deal with image, text, audio or video data, you can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array. Then you can convert this array into a ``torch.*Tensor``. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Here is a list of commonly used python packages to deal with different types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For images, packages such as Pillow, OpenCV are useful\n",
    "- For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa\n",
    "- For text, either raw Python or Cython based loading, or NLTK and SpaCy are useful\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Specially, in pytorch, a new package ``torchvision`` is built to deal with image data, which has data loaders for common datasets such as Imagenet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., ``torchvision.datasets`` and ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> In this tutorial, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.\n",
